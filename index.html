    <div> This is shitposting. I am starting to hate this again. And we learnt the hard way about css. And now we can't use it.
    And now we are going to use bullshit like SASS. Imagine grinding and having lots of headache and not even use the thing.
    </div> 
    
    <div> We watch a lot of videos about HTML and CSS, and given project just to discard them, along with the time you spent to learn them.
    It feels like a spit to the face.
    </div>
    
    <div> "Here, learn this for this week. Very important because assignment. 
    And now, don't use it. Instead build a website with the skills you don't have"
